# wgpu-rs-learning
This repo holds the code, with which I learn
[wgpu](https://docs.rs/wgpu/0.9.0/wgpu/index.html).

The main idea for me, is to keep an eye on my progress and track
milestones.

### Learning Resources
I will try to keep this list up to date with all resources, which
I use for learning.
